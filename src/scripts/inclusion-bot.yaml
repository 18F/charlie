# How this file works:
#
# This is a YAML file. You can read a little about them here:
# http://thomasloven.com/blog/2018/08/YAML-For-Nonprogrammers/
#
# The link property is where the "(What's this?)" links to. It is currently the
# 18F blog post about the original "guys bot."
#
# The message property is used to describe the purpose of the bot and encourage
# people to learn more. This is displayed after the list of triggering phrases
# and suggested alternatives.
#
# Aside from the comments here and the link and message properties, the rest of
# this file is largely automatically generated from the contents of
# InclusionBot.md. In general, this file should not be manually edited, in order
# to keep the two documents synchronized.
#
# One exception is that for Inclusion Bot triggers that should have specific
# exceptions (such as "Five Guys" for "guys"), those exceptions must be added to
# this file manually. They are preserved when this file is regenerated.
#
# When this file is generated, the "read more" context is removed to reduce the
# amount of content generated by the bot. Additionally, references to "this
# term" are replaced with the token :TERM:, which the bot will automatically
# replace with the actual word that triggered its response.

  Hello! Our inclusive TTS culture is built one interaction at a time, and
  <https://content-guide.18f.gov/our-style/inclusive-language/|inclusive
  language> is the foundation. This bot helps us practice our inclusive values
  here in TTS. Some of your message could be unintentionally non-inclusive. Here
  are some alternatives that might work better:
