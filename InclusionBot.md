# Background:

An inclusive culture is built one interaction at a time, and language is the
foundation. Inclusion bot helps us live
[our values](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/tts-history/#our-values) here in TTS.

To quote Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg: “If a culture’s language is full of pejorative
metaphors about a group of people, that culture is not going to see those people
as fully entitled to the same inclusion as people in a more favored group.”

# How to Update:

This file may be updated directly from GitHub by clicking the pencil icon above

says "Soft wrap" and change it to "No wrap" to make the file easier to read.
Then add your new contribution to one of the existing Markdown tables or create
a new section, as appropriate. You do not have to add all the extra spaces to
make things line up, it will work fine without it! (As a bonus, this file will
be automatically formatted when you open a pull request.) When you are finished,
scroll to the bottom of the page, click "Create a **new branch** for this commit
