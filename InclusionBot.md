# Background:

An inclusive culture is built one interaction at a time, and language is the
foundation. Inclusion bot helps us live
[our values](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/tts-history/#our-values) here in TTS.

To quote Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg: ‚ÄúIf a culture‚Äôs language is full of pejorative
metaphors about a group of people, that culture is not going to see those people
as fully entitled to the same inclusion as people in a more favored group.‚Äù

# How to Update:

The offensive words/phrases and alternatives listed in this doc are implemented
in the Inclusion Bot by updating
[the configuration file](https://github.com/18F/charlie/blob/main/src/scripts/inclusion-bot.yaml).
Anyone may update the configuration in the form of a GitHub pull request. The
file can be edited directly on the GitHub website, and it will offer to create
the pull request for you when you‚Äôre done editing. If you would like assistance
with updating the bot in GitHub, please reach out to Greg Walker or Ashley
Wichman. A summary of significant changes is available in
[Inclusion Bot‚Äôs changelog](https://github.com/18F/charlie/blob/main/CHANGELOG.inclusion_bot.md).
